# Final-Project-Repository
This is where I will show off my amazingly terrible code for my final project!

For this project I will be using an Ultrasonic sensor to pick up a signal to output different sounds depending on the frquency of the input. The build takes the frequency of two HC - SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Measuring Sensor Modules and changes the volume and tone of the sound being outputted based on the frequency of data being inputted. Essentially by the end of this build, hopefully a small mini theremin will have been built. As of this current moment I am able to get the signal sent out and the device reading all of the distance frequencies. I have both sensors shooting out signal one for volume, one for tone, but their ability to consistantly read the data and output the data is extremely clunky and sometimes inefficient. 

With this currenty build you will be able to get one of the sensors working. I have not yet quite figured out how to get the left sensor which determines the octave it will be played at working.

# Requirements and Materials

The libraries that are necessary are the following:
*No Libraries required
*Probably could of used the tone library after more research.

List of Materials needed

* 2x HC-SR04 Virtuabotix Ultrasonic Modules
* 3x 56k Resistors
* 1x KSP 2222A Transistor
* 25x Connector Wires(More than necessary but good incase they become damaged)
* 2x Breadboards
* 1x Arduino Genuino Uno
* 1x 8ohm 1.5w Speaker or basic Piezo Speaker will suffice


# Usage
* The right hand should control the volume of the frequency
* The left hand should control the pitch of the frequency

# Team
The team behind this project consists of not many, but one man.
* Joseph Maciag - I think this works?
