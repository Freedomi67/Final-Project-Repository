# Final-Project-Repository
This is where I will show off my amazingly terrible code for my final project!

For this project I will be using an Ultrasonic sensor to pick up a signal to output different sounds depending on the frquency of the input. The build takes the frequency of two HC - SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Measuring Sensor Modules and changes the volume and tone of the sound being outputted based on the frequency of data being inputted. Essentially by the end of this build, hopefully a small mini theramin will have been built. As of this current moment I am able to get the signal sent out and the device reading all of the distance frequencies. I have both sensors shooting out signal one for volume, one for tone, but their ability to consistantly read the data and output the data is extremely clunky and sometimes inefficient.

# Requirements and Materials

The libraries that are necessary are the following:
* NewPing V1.8 - https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-new-ping/wiki/Home
* This library is essential to be able to consistantly detecting the frequinces.
