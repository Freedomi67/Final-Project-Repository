# Final-Project-Repository
This is where I will show off my amazingly terribly code for my final project!
For this project I will be using an Ultrasound sensor to pick up a signal to output different sounds depending on the frquency of the input. So far I am able to hook up all my ultrasound sensors but being able to detect a change in frequency is rather difficult. Work still in progress.
